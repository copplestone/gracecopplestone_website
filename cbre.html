    <h1>CBRE interview preparation</h1>
    <h2>CBRE background</h2>
    <p>A Fortune 500 and S&P 500 company headquartered in Los Angeles, is the world’s largest commercial real estate services and investment firm.
    <br><br>
    On sustainability (no mention of climate change mitigation) - "We strongly believe that improving a property’s sustainability adds to its value. In addition to their intrinsic worth, sustainable solutions also enhance the appeal of a building, making it a favourable prospect for leases and sales in the long term. We are eager to team up with you to develop your sustainability strategy and take practical steps towards achieving your sustainability ambitions." 
    </p>

    <h3>CBRE Mid-Year Market Outlook 2020</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Share of foreign capital has remained unchanged.</li>
        <li>Logistics and residential continue to perform well. Retail is polarized and hotels aren't performing well.</li>
        <li>Spread of investment is more even which makes it less susceptible than it was during the financial crisis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Increasing focus on sustainability at CBRE - The Real Impact Project</h3>
    <p>"We commit to realize 25% of the CO2 reductions for commercial real estate from the climate agreement with you, before 2030."</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"During 2020, CBRE is going to integrate sustainability advice in every service line. Not as an appendix, but as an integrated part of each service we provide."</li>
        <li>"As of 2020, CBRE is going to monitor, benchmark and share the CO2 reduction of every property we work on across every business line. We will disclose the progress made."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A huge project, how will this change the work of the Development Services department? Will it all come from your team? And who and how is measurement and reporting going to happen?</p>


    <h3>CBRE Development Services</h3>
    <p>Outside-the-box solutions for property improvement, renovation, and redevelopment. Aimed at strengthening your image and adding to the value of your building.</p>

    <h2>Sustainability regulation in the Netherlands</h2>
    <p>For all new construction, both residential and non-residential, the permit applications must meet the requirements for Nearly Energy Neutral Buildings (BENG) from 1 January 2021.</p>

    <p>How will this impact the work being done of the Development services team?</p>

    <h2>Understanding the team</h2>
    <p>Anne Leeuw - Consultant Sustainability. Below are outcomes from thesis</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A window to wall ratio or 40% leads to lower cooling loads for De Rotterdam and it will do so for most office buildings in moderate to hot climates, where the cooling demand is much higher than the heating demand.</li>  
        <li>High rise with a high window to wall ratio will have no future in the built environment, unless transparent energy production technology will see great efficiency improvement.</li>
        <li> High rise which does not use free sources of heat and cold for climate control purposes, could never become energy neutral</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>Hannah Scott - Sustainability Strategist, Senior Consultant Development Services</p>
    <p>Tim Habraken - Associate Director Sustainability</p>
